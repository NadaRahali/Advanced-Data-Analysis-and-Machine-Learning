# Week 2: Neural Network Fundamentals

## Overview
This week focuses on building and training neural networks:
- Multi-layer perceptrons
- Loss functions
- Optimization algorithms
- Batch processing and mini-batches

## Exercises

### Exercise 2.1: Multi-Layer Perceptron
Build a multi-layer perceptron for classification tasks.

### Exercise 2.2: Loss Functions
Implement and compare different loss functions (MSE, Cross-Entropy).

### Exercise 2.3: Optimizers
Compare different optimization algorithms (SGD, Adam, RMSprop).
