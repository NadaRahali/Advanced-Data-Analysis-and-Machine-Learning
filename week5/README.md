# Week 5: Advanced Architectures

## Overview
This week explores advanced deep learning architectures:
- Autoencoders and Variational Autoencoders (VAE)
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- Attention mechanisms
- Transformer architectures

## Exercises

### Exercise 5.1: Autoencoders
Build an autoencoder for dimensionality reduction.

### Exercise 5.2: GANs
Implement a basic GAN for image generation.

### Exercise 5.3: Attention Mechanisms
Explore attention mechanisms in neural networks.
