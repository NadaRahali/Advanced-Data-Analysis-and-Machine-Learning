# Week 6: Optimization and Regularization

## Overview
This week focuses on improving model performance:
- Regularization techniques (L1, L2, Dropout)
- Batch normalization
- Learning rate scheduling
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model evaluation and validation

## Exercises

### Exercise 6.1: Regularization
