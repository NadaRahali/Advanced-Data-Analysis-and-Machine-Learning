# Week 4: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

## Overview
This week covers sequential data processing:
- Recurrent Neural Networks
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)
- Sequence-to-sequence models

## Exercises

### Exercise 4.1: Basic RNN
Implement a basic RNN for sequence prediction.

### Exercise 4.2: LSTM Networks
Build an LSTM network for time series analysis.

### Exercise 4.3: Text Generation
